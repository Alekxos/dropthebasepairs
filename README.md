Predicting chromatin accessibility markers to identify gene SNIPs involved in leukemia onset and regulation.

Final code can be found with the heading "final_".  
There are three files with "final_analysis" that contain the code required to analyze the model using genetic motifs, confusion matrices, and sensitivity/specificity curves.
There is one file with heading "final_CNNmodel" that was used read in the data, train the CNN on genetic sequence inputs and chromatin accessibility outputs, and evaluate test accuracy and metric on the train/dev/test sets.

Thank you for viewing our code.  Have a great day/night! :)

Your friends,
Alex and Brandon
